# Heart Disease ML Project

This is a fun machine learning and data science project that I'll be utilizing [UCI's Heart Disease DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

I am planning improving my data science skills, as well as my machine learning skills. I'll be doing a full data exploratory process that'll allow my to apply
data science techniques to observe the dataset and understand more about it before
just using an ML algorithm.  

After this, I am planning on building out 4 ML models: Multiple Linear Regression,
 Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Network to see how each model compares to one another. I'll specifically be working on my feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning skills to further improve my machine learning engineering skills!  

 ## Requirements
 * Python 3.7
 * Anaconda Environment
 * Jupyter Notebook (if you want to observe my ipynb)  


 ## Step-by-Step Guide  
 * Will be coming in the future! :)
